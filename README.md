## Hospital Management System (Frontend Only)

This is a **frontend-only Hospital Management System (HMS)** built with **React.js** for a final-year academic project.

### Tech Stack
- **React.js**
- **react-router-dom**
- **React Context API**
- **Chart.js**
- **react-icons**

### Key Features
- Role-based access: **Patient**, **Doctor**, **Admin**
- Clean, modular, and well-structured React code
- Mock/static data only (see `src/data/mockData.js`)
- **MPIN-based document locker** for patients
- **Chart.js analytics** in Doctor and Admin dashboards
- Fully responsive, healthcare-themed UI with a shared design system

### Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the URL printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

You can explain this project in a viva by walking through:
- The **auth flow** managed by `AuthContext`
- **Protected routes** for each role
- How **mockData** powers every page
- How **Chart.js** is integrated into analytics components
- The **MPIN locker** UI logic and validation.
